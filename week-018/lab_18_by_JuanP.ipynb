    "As you can see we have a couple of issues:\n",
    "* The column `names` has, in some cases, both the hero name and their secret identity. In other cases, it has the universe the hero is from (usually Earth-616). We'd like for `name` to be the superhero. If a secret identity name is available, we'd like for that to be in it's own column. We'd also like a column `origin` for the superhero's place of origin (usually Earth-616).\n",
    "* The `urlslug` column is incorrect. We'd like for that to be a complete link. For example, spiderman's wikia link is https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Peter_Parker_(Earth-616) but if you use the `Spider-Man_(Peter_Parker)` from the `urlslug` (https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Spider-Man_(Peter_Parker), the page redirects to the correct page. You can choose to fix it various different ways but it should be a working link. Use \"https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/\" as the beginning of your url.\n",
    "* For the column `align`, we'd like for the \"Characters\" part to be removed. We'd like for that column to be categorical (Good, Neutral, Evil or blank).\n",
    "* Same for the columns `EYE`, `HAIR`, `SEX` and `ID`. We want to drop the extraneous data and have simple categories (e.g. for `ID` we want categories [\"Known\",\"Public\", \"Secret\", \"None\"] and for `SEX` we just want [\"Male\", \"Female\",\"Genderfluid\",\"Agender\"]. There's a way shown below that shows the various possible categories.\n",
    "* Some data is in the wrong format. For example, `Year` and `APPEARANCES` are floats but they really should be ints (as you cannot have a non-int number of appearances). \n",
    "* Some data doesn't match up (like the `FIRST APPEARANCE` and `Year` columns might have not be the same year)\n",
    "* Some columns are unnecessary. Some are missing data. Some rows are duplicates. Fix those as necessary.\n",
    "* Some column names are written as uppercase, some are lowercase and some are mixed case. Normalize them so all the column names are in the same format.\n",
